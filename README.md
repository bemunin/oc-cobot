# OmniCraft Cobot Project


A simulation scene built with NVIDIA Isaac Sim for experimenting with a robot arm (cobot) and the YOLO object detection model.

![Scene from extension oc.cobot.yolo](docs/images/oc_cobot_yolo_scene.png "Scene from extension oc.cobot.yolo")

The goal of this project is to provide an example of how to create an NVIDIA Isaac Sim scene from scratch, control a robot manipulator, and use it for experimenting with modern computer vision algorithms.

## Project Files and Directories
- `sim.py`: Main entry point, a standalone workflow script to launch the NVIDIA Isaac Sim app and run the `oc.cobot.yolo` extension.  
- `assets/`: Contains all USD models composed in the scene.
- `docs/`: Stores the project's files and documentation.
- `exts/`: Project's Isaac Sim extension. You can add new extensions to suit your work here.
  - `oc.cobot.yolo`: An extension that contains the application logic of this example.  
- `launch/`: Contains sub-functions used in `sim.py` to launch the simulation application.
- `utils/`: Shared utility functions that are used frequently in the project.

## Getting Started

> 📌 The project is being developed in an Ubuntu environment and is not yet guaranteed to work with Windows.

1. Install Conda by following the [official Conda installation guide for Linux](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html). Use the **Anaconda Distribution installer for Linux**.

2. Clone the project and change the directory to the `oc-cobot` root:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bemunin/oc-cobot.git
    cd oc-cobot
    ```

3. Make a copy of `environment.yml` and rename it to `environment.local.yml`.

4. Inside the `environment.local.yml` file, change `<user>` in the `prefix:` key to match your Anaconda path.

5. At the root of the project directory, run this command to create the `oc_cobot` Conda environment:

    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.local.yml
    ```

6. Activate the `oc_cobot` Conda environment:

    ```sh
    conda activate oc_cobot
    ```

7. Run the `sim.py` script to start the simulation:

    ```sh
    python sim.py
    ```

    ⚠️ **Note:**
    - The first time it runs, it might take some time to load the program and scene as NVIDIA Isaac Sim has not yet cached the data.
    - There will be a prompt from NVIDIA asking you to agree with the NVIDIA License. Type `Y` and press Enter to accept. You only need to do this once.

8. After the simulation starts, you can interact with the scene via the control panel on the top left.
